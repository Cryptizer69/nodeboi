# Network Management Solution

The network management interface works perfectly but has issues when accessed through the NODEBOI fancy menu system.

## ‚úÖ WORKING SOLUTIONS

### Option 1: Direct Script (Recommended)
```bash
cd ~/.nodeboi
./manage_networks.sh
```

### Option 2: Shortcut Command
```bash
cd ~/.nodeboi
./networks
```

### Option 3: System Command (requires sudo setup)
```bash
# First time setup (run once):
sudo ln -sf /home/floris/.nodeboi/networks /usr/local/bin/networks

# Then use anywhere:
networks
```

## üîó Interface Features

- **Dashboard Display**: Shows NODEBOI header and node status
- **Checkbox Interface**: `[ ]` for disconnected, `[x]` for connected networks
- **Multi-Select**: Enter numbers like `1 2` to select multiple networks
- **Quick Actions**: 
  - `A` = Select all networks
  - `D` = Deselect all networks  
  - `S` = Save and exit
  - `Q` = Quit without saving

## üìù Example Usage

```
üîó Docker Network Connections
==============================

Networks available for monitoring connection:

  1) [x] ethnode1 (3 services)
  2) [ ] ethnode2 (3 services)

Actions:
  Enter numbers (e.g., '1 2 4') to select networks
  A) Connect all networks
  D) Disconnect all networks
  S) Save current selection
  Q) Back to monitoring menu

Your choice: 2
```

This will toggle ethnode2 from disconnected `[ ]` to connected `[x]`.

## üö´ Known Issue

The "Manage monitoring" dynamic menu item was causing crashes and has been removed from the main NODEBOI menu. Monitoring features are now available through the "Services" menu.

For network management, use the direct scripts above for the most reliable experience.
